## 2.1. Where are your programs stored when they are running?

### Challenge Solution

Memory.

## Notes
* **Central Processing Unit:** Runs the program - The CPU is always wondering "what to do next". Not the brains exactly - very dumb but very fast
* **Input Devices:** Keyboard, Mouse, Touch Screen
* **Output Devices:** Screen, Speakers, Printer, DVD Burner
* **Main Memory:** Fast small temporary storage - lost on reboot - aka RAM
* **Secondary Memory:** Slower large permanent storage - lasts until deleted - disk drive / memory stick

Your Python code is stored in your secondary memory, then that is loaded into main memory and while you are running, it's communicating with your CPU a billion times a second.

Python just translates your code into machine language.
