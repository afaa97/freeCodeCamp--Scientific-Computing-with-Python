# About
[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is an amazing initiative and an excellent, free resource helping thousands of people learn to code. 

## Certifications

It offers several developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of coding challenges and this repository capture my personal solutions to all of those challenges and projects. freeCodeCamp estimate that each certification generally takes approx. **300 hours** to earn.

Each of these **65 projects** in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help users build up project incrementally and ensure fulfillment of all the user stories before submission.

## Publicly Available

Initially, it was just a locally hosted collection of files and folders to keep track of my own progress through the curriculum, but eventually I decided to publicly share the solutions with the intention of helping other students who might get stuck or who might want to see how someone else approached the same exercise and learn from their approach.

Just like freeCodeCamp, this repository is meant to be a learning resource assisting you in your quest to become a proficient web developer. It is not meant to let you copy and paste the solutions, so that you can get through the curriculum as quickly as possible. 

Do the challenges on your own, write your own code that passes the tests, and consult this repository only if you truly have no idea how to pass an exercise or to check if there is perhaps a better, simpler or more efficient way of solving it. 

Copying the solutions into the freeCodeCamp editor might let you cheat your way through the system, but it will not help you become a better developer. **The only person you will be cheating is yourself.** 

## Pull Requests
freeCodeCamp is a living project that develops and changes over time. After I complete all courses I will not update this repository, unless they create another course. As such, some of the solutions may become outdated or even irrelevant. The same goes for the file structure, exercise names, etc.
